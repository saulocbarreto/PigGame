## Game Rules

* The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
* In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
* BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
* The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
* The first player to reach 100 points (or the value defined above the dices) on GLOBAL score wins the game
* A player loses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 (in any dice) in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.
